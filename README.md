## About
ExTra is an app that tracks your expenses and gives you a visual representation of your daily, weekly or monthly spending. For daily, you can see your spending breakdown as a pie chart to see what percentage of that day's spending went to each category. For the weekly and monthly, a line graph is used to show a comparison of how much you have spent for each day. You can also create accounts with an initial amount of money that you can add transactions to.

## Technologies
The frontend was built using React, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. Because there is no backend to persist data, the app uses the browser's local storage.
